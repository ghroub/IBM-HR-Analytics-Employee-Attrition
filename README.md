# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition & Performance

In this project, we are going to explore a HR Employee Attrition dataset that is related to employee turnover in a company using python liibrariies such as pandas, matplotlib, pyplot, and seaborn to answer some questions and examine trends.

Some business questions we are going to answer are:

What factors are contributing more to employee attrition?
What is the age range of the employees who left the company?
Which Department has the most Attrition Rate?
