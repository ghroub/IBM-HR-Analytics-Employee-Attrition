# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition & Performance


## Installation
In this project, we are going to explore and examine trends in a HR Employee Attrition dataset that is related to employee turnover in a company using the following python libraries:
- pandas==1.0.1
- matplotlib==3.1.3
- seaborn==0.10.0


## File Description
The project contains 2 files:
1- IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition/HR-Employee-Attrition.csv: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset.
2- IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition/Employee_Attrition.ipynb: A notebook containing the data analysis.


Some business questions we are going to answer through the analysis are:

What factors are contributing more to employee attrition?
What is the age range of the employees who left the company?
Which Department has the most Attrition Rate?

Insights are published in a Medium post: https://medium.com/@galjandal/ibm-hr-analytics-employee-attrition-performance-08096fdf1c23
