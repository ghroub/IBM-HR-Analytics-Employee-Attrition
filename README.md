# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition & Performance

In this project, we are going to explore and examine trends in a HR Employee Attrition dataset that is related to employee turnover in a company using the following python libraries:
- pandas==1.0.1
- matplotlib==3.1.3
- seaborn==0.10.0

The project contains 2 fiiles:
1- IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition/HR-Employee-Attrition.csv: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset.
2- IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition/Employee_Attrition.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.


Some business questions we are going to answer through the analysis are:

What factors are contributing more to employee attrition?
What is the age range of the employees who left the company?
Which Department has the most Attrition Rate?
